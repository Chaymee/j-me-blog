Today marks a historic day for me.  I am making my first blog post on my new self hosted blog.  I will use this blog as a place to store my experiences working on projects.  I plan to work on projects like IoT, application development, 3D pringing and projects for Solace.  I plan to keep my project posts to 1 or 2 parts.  Thank you for joining me on my journey to building enjoyable projects.
